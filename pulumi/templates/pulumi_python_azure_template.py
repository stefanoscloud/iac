Pulumi Python Template for Azure

This script uses Pulumi's Python SDK to define and provision Azure resources. Pulumi allows you to use real programming languages for Infrastructure as Code.

To deploy using Pulumi:
1. Ensure you've set up Pulumi and configured it with Azure credentials.
2. Navigate to the directory containing this file.
3. Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes.

This template defines a resource group and a storage account as an example. You can expand it with more resources as required.

    # Other resources can be defined similarly...

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Outputs
pulumi.export('storage_account_id', account.id)

# For testing, consider using Pulumi's built-in testing framework. Tests can be written in a separate file.
